/* =============================================================================
   DECK CONFIG — the ONE file you edit to make a new deck.
   Loaded by deck.html, index.html and presenter.html.

   1. Paste your Supabase URL + publishable key below.
   2. Set your brand + copy.
   3. Define the `flow` — each entry is one attendee checkpoint.
   4. Replace the slides in deck.html (content only; the engine stays).

   Interaction types supported per flow entry:
     - "single" : pick exactly one chip
     - "multi"  : pick many chips (optional max + exclusive keys)
     - "quiz"   : a run of Yes/No questions -> a verdict picked by #yes
     - "text"   : one open-ended answer in a textarea (optional; free text)
   Copy an existing entry to add a checkpoint. Everything downstream
   (attendee flow, presenter panels, room map) is derived from this array.
